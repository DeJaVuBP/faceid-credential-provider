# Face Recognition System with Windows Credential Provider Integration

This project develops a face recognition system and integrates it into Windows login process by creating a custom Credential Provider. The system enables users to authenticate and log in to Windows using facial recognition, enhancing security and user convenience.

## Project Overview
- Implement face detection and recognition using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, and face_recognition.
- Develop a Windows Credential Provider in C++ that communicates with the face recognition module.
- Enable seamless biometric login by integrating the face recognition system into the Windows authentication framework.


## Technologies Used
- Python (OpenCV, Dlib, face_recognition)
- C++ (Windows Credential Provider development)
- Windows SDK

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition for Windows login.
- Secure communication between Credential Provider and face recognition module.
- Compatibility with Windows login screen.
